This project inlcudes an initial landing page along with 2 survey pages and a thank you page. The survey asks questions on personal information and lifestyle.


This webform follows standard practices for many different aspects of web design. Firstly, it uses colors that are distinct and easily read.
The webform uses aria-label tags where needed to describe the page to non-visual web users. 

The webform asks questions in a single column on one side of the page and ask questions that flow nicely with little friction to ensure users complete the entire survey. The survey also has questions that follow a specifc order so users can easily fill out questions with the same answer types in a row. 

The questions are also grouped in order so similar data is collected at once. The form also follows best practices by limiting the number of questions asked per page and denotes how far along the participant is into filling out the webform with a progress bar at the bottom that shows the progress of the participant. 

The fonts on the page are simple and the webform ends on a webpage that thanks the participant for submitting their survey in order to denote that the form was recieved.
